### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Jon! âœ¨

ðŸš€ I'm a passionate software engineer with a focus on web applications and building clean user interfaces. While I'm trained as a full stack developer, my passion lies in frontend development. I use technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like React and Vue.js. I also have experience with back-end development using Node.js, Express, and database technologies such as MongoDB and PostgreSQL.

ðŸŒ± My background is in tech sales and customer experience, most recently at [Slack](https://slack.com/), and I've recently obtained a diploma through [Coder Academy](https://coderacademy.edu.au/) (take a look at what I built below!).

ðŸ’¼ Currently, I'm open to collaborating and speaking to companies about how I can build experiences that delight your customers, so feel free to reach out!

ðŸ“¬ You can connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonphey/).
